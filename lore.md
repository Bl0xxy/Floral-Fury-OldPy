## Backstory
There was a poor farmer who spent every day struggling to make enough money to eat anything.  All the food he grew had to be sold as he needed to keep his home.

## The Downfall
The year is 2053, and the world has been taken over by mutated plants.  The plants have evolved to cover the doors of houses, and they are mostly unbreakable.  If this continues, people will be stuck in their houses for eternity.  The farmer decides he wants to help out and become an adventurer.

## New Discovery
Scientists have made a serum that makes the plants crumble.  It injects a special salt into the plant that the plant cannot handle.  The plants can survive long periods of time without water, but this new injection kills the plants.  If the farmer can go around house to house killing these plants, then people will be freed.

## Comeback For The Plants
After some time of peace, the plants find new ways to evolve to survive this injection.  Now, the plants are able to use the injection as food to strengthen them.

## New Goal
Find the mystical plant slayer sword to destroy the plants and save the villages. 

## Peace
The plants have permanently died, and are gone.
